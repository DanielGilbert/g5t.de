        <h4>A convenient way to blog... I thought.</h4>
        <p>2 years ago, in 2023, I created <a href="https://github.com/DanielGilbert/Radia/">Radia</a>. The idea was to create a simple, almost way too easy to use replacement for the directory listing server I was using before.</p>
        <p><em>Radia</em> was meant to work on Markdown files and directly work with Git repositories. I never really finished the implementation to work with remote repositories. <em>Radia</em> would automatically clone a repository and pull changes.</p>
        <p>That, of course, means that there should really never be any issues regarding merge conflicts or anything.</p>
        <p>Another issue pops up if you consider that the tool needs to be constantly updated and checked for security issues. I set up dependabot for the repository, but of course, the pull requests still needed to be approved.</p>
        <h4>Restart</h4>
        <p>So a few days ago, I stumbled upon <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43954896">a submission</a> on HackerNews that linked to <a href="https://plainvanillaweb.com">Plain Vanilla Web</a>. I read through the first paragraphs, and it instantly clicked: "Back in the days"&trade;, we wrote websites and code by hand. I never really dived into the deep of web development, mainly because I've always been a desktop guy.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, that means I completely missed the framework loaded times of and days. I never worked with React, Angular, Vue or similar before.</p>
        <p>I started working with Blazor at my current employer (before transitioning to a new role inside the company), and that really means I had to dive into all things Sass, Html, Javascript, npm and so on.</p>
        <p>I took some inspiration from Joeri's <em>Plain Vanilla</em> project, mainly regarding the structure of my project, but also for the components. The header and the footer are web components. One downside is, that they need Javascript to work. So... Yeah, if you are one of these people that deactivate Javascript, you won't be able to navigate around. But I still like you, so reading the articles is not a problem at all.</p>
        <p>This page now uses <a href="https://picocss.com/">PicoCSS</a> for styling, and otherwise plain javascript for functionality.</p>
        <h4>Future</h4>
        <p>My hope and ideas are that I'm going to blog and write far more often than I did in the past. I don't know why I didn't do it, maybe because the process was way too overblown.</p>
