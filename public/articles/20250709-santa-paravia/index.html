        <h3>Entering the rabbit hole</h3>
        <p>Recently, I got into a rabbit hole of old city planning games. The very first I found was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sumerian_Game">The Sumerian Game</a>. Created by Mabel Addis in 1964, it was one of the earliest text-based strategy video games of land and resource management.</p>
        <p>Other games in the same vain are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamurabi_(video_game)">Hamurabi (1968)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukedom_(video_game)">Dukedom (1976)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty_(computer_game)">Dynasty (1978)</a>.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, text-based games see some kind of renaissance, thanks to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/659540/Warsim_The_Realm_of_Aslona/">Warsim</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3273130/Roots_of_Harmony/">Roots of Harmony</a></p>
        <p>In this article, I will focus on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Paravia_en_Fiumaccio">Santa Paravia en Fiumaccio</a>, a game located in the 15th century in italy. This game was created in 1978 by George Blank, and published in the December 1978 issue of <em>SoftSide</em> magazine for the TRS-80.</p>
        <p>Wikipedia says this about the game:</p>
        <blockquote>Based loosely on the text game Hamurabi, <em>Santa Paravia and Fiumaccio</em> was an early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_game">god game</a>. It combined '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns_versus_butter_model">guns and butter</a>' economic tradeoffs with graphic development of a kingdom with buildings being constructed and shown on the screen as well as character development, shown as progressive promotions from baron to king.  <footer>
    <cite>â€” Wikipedia</cite>
  </footer></blockquote>
        <p>The goal of the game is to progress from <em>Lady</em> (or <em>Sir</em>) to <em>H.R.H Queen</em> (or <em>H.R.H King</em>), meanwhile defending attackers and distributing grain according to need and availablilty. You can (and should) by additional land, grain and can control taxes.</p>
        <p>A fellow called <em>Thomas Knox</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141129011448/http://planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=7183&lngWId=3">converted the original TRS-80 code to ANSI-C in 2003</a>. In his conversion, he skipped the map part of the original game. We will get to that when we take a look at the implementation.</p>
        <h3>Let's dive into the code</h3>
        <p><em>Note: If you are interested in the original TRS-80 listing, you will find it here: <a href="https://archive.org/details/softside-magazine-03/">SoftSide Magazine Issue 03 (Santa Parvia)</a></em></p>
        <p><em>The converted code can be found <a href="https://github.com/DanielGilbert/Paravia">at GitHub</a>.</em></p>
        <p><b>Disclaimer:</b> I'm no mathematician. I'm a programmer. As such, if I try to describe algorithms or equations used in this game, I'll do that using the terminology of a programmer. There is no point in using a language I do not speak.</p>
        <p>Let's unpack the main <em>Run()</em> method of the C# conversion.</p>
        <div class="code-block">

        <p>The game relies in parts on randomization. As such, it is no surprise that we need to initialize random functionality. From line <b>3</b>&nbsp;&dash;&nbsp;<b>12</b>, the game will setup the randomizer, greet the player and ask, if the player needs further instructions. If confirmed, the game calls <code>PrintInstructions()</code>.</p>
        <p>A computer back in the days was a highlight to everyone. They were rather expensive, so there was usually one computer for the entire family. As such, it is no wonder that you are able to play this game at the same terminal with more than 1 player. Lines <b>14</b>&nbsp;&dash;&nbsp;<b>21</b> handle the logic to request the amount of players that are currently in this session.</p>
        <p>Lines <b>23</b>&nbsp;&dash;&nbsp;<b>38</b> set up the difficulty level for this game. It offers four level of difficulty. The numeric value of difficulty is used in the progression calculation of the game, which we will see more of later on.</p>
        <p>Depending on the amount of players, lines <b>40</b>&nbsp;&dash;&nbsp;<b>56</b> loop several times and setup the list of players by asking for names and initializing the player. <code>InitializePlayer()</code> is used to set several variables to its' initial state. That are not all variables that belong to the <code>player</code> record, but it's already an impressive list:</p>
        <div class="code-block">

        <p><code>Random(35);</code> is another function that is used rather often in this game. It will provide a random integer between 0 and the supplied parameters, exclusively. In this case, we will receive an integer between 0 and 34.</p>
        <p>The game also predetermines your year of death by using the start year (that is always <em>1400</em>), adding <em>20</em> to it (so you will at least play 20 rounds), and then randomly give you the aforementioned 0 to 34 more extra rounds. Of course, you might be defeated by other events, but at some point, you will lose because you died.</p>
        <p>Back to the original code. The only thing that is left to do is to call <code>PlayGame()</code>:</p>

        <p>Lines <b>11</b>&nbsp;&dash;&nbsp;<b>39</b> are running the main loop as long as at least one player is not dead, or none of the players has won the game.

            </line-numbers>
        </div>
        <p>Finally, we are able to dive into the nooks and crannies of this game. Each turn, the game will run the following steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>GenerateHarvest()</code>: Calculate the harvest, the amount of rats and the grain reserve. Harvest and rats are randomized numbers.</li>
            <li><code>NewLandAndGrainPrices()</code>: Calculate the land prices, the grain reserve, the demand for grain and how many grain got eaten by the rats.</li>
            <li><code>BuySellGrain()</code>: Display the grain reserve, the grain demand, the price of grain, price of land and the amount of money owned to the player. Also, ask the player what they would like to do next: Buy land or grain, sell land or grain or move to the next step.</li>
            <li><code>ReleaseGrain()</code>: The player is asked how much grain they want to release to the serfs. The player must keep at least a reserve of 20%, and they have to give out at least 20% of the whole reserve.</li>
            <li>The loop from lines <b>8</b>&nbsp;&dash;&nbsp;<b>28</b> deals with the attack logic. The player object contains a flag, <code>InvadeMe</code>, which signals that the player is too weak to defend against an opponent, which will trigger the attack logic. This is where the baron comes in play, if you are a single player. Line <b>25</b> will launch the attack with the baron, if there is only one player.</li>
            <li><code>AdjustTax()</code>: As a player, you can adjust the customs duty, the sales tax, the wealth tax and the amount of justice. In this method, the game also calculates the revenue the player made and will seize any assets, if the player is bankrupt.</li>
            <li><code>DrawMap()</code>: In the original TRS-80 code, this draws a neat map that shows you how many buildings you have, and how much land you have in comparison to serfs.</li>
            <li><code>StatePurchases()</code>: Nowadays, one would refer to it as the <em>buy screen</em>. Here, you can buy a marketplace, a woolen mill, a palace (partially), a cathedral (partially) and convert serfs to soldiers.</li>
            <li><code>CheckNewTitle()</code>: This is the progression logic. Here, the game calculates the progression based on multiple values with a cap on each. We'll take a closer look later on.</li>
            <li><code>ImDead()</code>: Yes. It does, what it says. It will print a small in memoriam message, and also randomly pick a cause of death. If you made it past <em>1450</em>, the only cod will be "<em>of old age after a long reign.</em>", which is kinda neat, to be honest.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The four phases of the game</h3>
        <p>The original explanation for the game calls out four phases: <em>Harvest Phase</em>, <em>Tax Phase</em>, <em>Map Phase</em> and <em>Public Works Phase</em>. We will dive into each of the phases, referencing the code we just uncovered, and talk a bit about how the game does what (or what I think the game does - I might not have fully understood everything).</p>
        <h4>Harvest Phase</h4>
        <p>The functions involved in this phase are the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>GenerateHarvest()</code></li>
            <li><code>NewLandAndGrainPrices()</code></li>
            <li><code>BuySellGrain()</code></li>
            <li><code>ReleaseGrain()</code></li>
        </ul>
        <h5>GenerateHarvest()</h5>
        <p>The game calculates a random value as harvest, by adding two values. Ones goes from 0&nbsp;&dash;&nbsp;4 and the other from 0&nbsp;&dash;&nbsp;6 - the result is then divided by 2 in an integer division. Rats are also assigned, randomly, on a scale from 0&nbsp;&dash;&nbsp;49.</p>
        <p>Finally, the game will calculate the grain reserve by multiplying the existing grain reserve with 100, subtracting the grain reserve multiplied by the amount of rats, and divide everything by 100 again: <code>((player.GrainReserve * 100) - (player.GrainReserve * player.Rats)) / 100</code></p>
        <p>This means that, if <code>Rats</code> goes up to 50, your grain reserve will be cut in half, whereas if there are zero rats, your reserve will remain unchanged.</p>
        <figure><img src="./graph-grain-reserve.png"></img><figcaption>This graph shows the distribution for grain reserve, given that the amount of rats is 50 (the green, dashed graph) or 0 (the purple, solid graph), and X gives the amount of grain in reserve.</figcaption></figure>
        <h5>NewLandAndGrainPrices()</h5>
        <p>This method calculates the grain reserve, the grain demand, land price and what the rats ate. It does that by using two variables, x and y. For this one, I will include the code, so you can follow along with my explanation.</p>
        
<div class="code-block">
        <line-numbers>
            <syntax-highlight language="clike">private void NewLandAndGrainPrices(Player player)
{
    double x, y, myRandom;
    int h;

    //Generate an offset for use in later int->float conversions.
    myRandom = Randomizer.NextDouble();

    /* If you think this C# code is ugly, you should see the original C. */
    x = player.Land;
    y = ((player.Serfs - player.Mills) * 100.0) * 5.0;
    if (y < 0.0)
    {
        y = 0.0;
    }

    if (y < x)
    {
        x = y;
    }

    y = player.GrainReserve * 2.0;

    if (y < x)
    {
        x = y;
    }

    y = player.Harvest + (myRandom + 0.5);
    h = Convert.ToInt32(x * y);

    player.GrainReserve += h;
    player.GrainDemand = (player.Nobles * 100) + (player.Cathedral * 40) + (player.Merchants * 30);
    player.GrainDemand += ((player.Soldiers * 10) + (player.Serfs * 5));
    player.LandPrice = (3.0 * player.Harvest + Convert.ToDouble(Random(6)) + 10.0) / 10.0;

    if (h < 0)
    {
        h *= -1;
    }

    if (h < 1)
    {
        y = 2.0;
    }
    else
    {
        y = Convert.ToDouble(player.GrainDemand / (double)h);
        if (y > 2.0)
        {
            y = 2.0;
        }
    }

    if (y < 0.8)
    {
        y = 0.8;
    }

    player.LandPrice *= y;

    if(player.LandPrice < 1.0)
    {
        player.LandPrice = 1.0;
    }

    player.GrainPrice = Convert.ToInt32(((6.0 - player.Harvest) * 3.0 + Random(5) + Random(5)) * 4.0 * y);
    player.RatsAte = h;
}               </syntax-highlight>
            </line-numbers>
        </div>
        <p>x gets the value of <code>player.Land</code>, which is the amount of land the player owns.</p>
        <p>y is calculated in this way: <code>y = ((player.Serfs - player.Mills) * 100.0) * 5.0;</code></p>
        <p>Afterwards, the method performs a sanity check on the y value: If it becomes less than 0.0, it will be set to 0.0, so y should never be negative. If y is smaller than x, than x will be set to y.</p>
        <p>y than receives a new value. It is calculated by <code>player.GrainReserve * 2.0</code>. Again, another sanity check is performed, with the same result: If y is smaller than x, y will be assigned to x.</p>
        <p>That means that, by now, x is either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The amount of Land the player owns</li>
            <li>Amount of serfs minus the amount of mills multiplied by 500</li>
            <li>Grain reserve multiplied by 2</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After all that, y will be reused:</p>
        <p><code>y = player.Harvest + (myRandom + 0.5);</code> MyRandom is an offset, calculated in line <b>7</b>. Basically, it is a random double between <em>0.0</em> and <em>1.0</em></p>
        <p><code>h = Convert.ToInt32(x * y);</code> is the final variable needed. So the player's harvest (plus offset) is multiplied by either of the three possibilities mentioned earlier, and then converted to int. As discussed before, harvest will be a value between <b>0</b> and <b>5</b>.</p>
        <p>The result of the previous operation is than added to <code>GrainReserve</code>. This gives us the very first value for this operation, the new grain reserve.</p>
        <p>Next, the grain demand is calculated. That operation is pretty straight forward.</p>

        <p>The land price calculation spans from <b>35</b> to <b>65</b>. Let's dive a bit deeper into the mechanics:</p>
        <p>The initial land price is calculated by multiplying the players harvest (0 - 5) with 3, adding a random number between 0 - 5, and adding 10 to it. This result is then divided by ten. With this formula, the result of the land price calculation varies between 1 and 3.</p>
        <p>However, from playing the game, I know that there are land prices below 2, so there is, of course, more happening. The next block will do some operations on <em>h</em> and <em>y</em>. Basically, h will be flipped if it is negative (so it get's positive), and if h is smaller than 1, then y is set to 2. If h is bigger than 2, the grain demand is divided by h. y on the other hand is capped by 2, and by 0.8 on the lower end.</p>
        <p>The land price is than further reduced because it get's multiplied by y. If land price goes below 1.0 though, it will be reset to 1.0</p>
        <p>Grain price is finally calculated by this formula:</p>
        <p><code>Convert.ToInt32(((6.0 - player.Harvest) * 3.0 + Random(5) + Random(5)) * 4.0 * y);</code> - again, lot's of random values that get added. From my understanding, the lowest value this formula can output is 9.6, and the highest is 208. That resonates with my experience during the game. While the randomized inputs carry quite some variance in the result, the biggest impact comes from the harvest. And that totally makes sense. The higher the harvest number goes, the lower the price for grain goes (as there is no shortage).</p>
        <p>Finally, the value that calculated for h, will also be the fate of your reserve in terms of how much the rats ate.</p>
        <h5>BuySellGrain()</h5>
        <p>Not much to see here. This one will allow you to sell or buy either land or grain. It will then go ahead and perform the necessary operations on the resources, and will also add or subtract to or from the treasury.</p>
        <h5>ReleaseGrain</h5>
        <p>This one is fun. It will be the most complex function we will take a look at today.</p>

        <p>Lines <b>13</b>&nbsp;&dash;&nbsp;<b>38</b> deal with the fundamental question of how much grain you will distribute for consumption. The game limits you in what you are able to do: You should release at least 20% of your available grain, but you must not release more than 80%. Once these constraints are satisfied, you are allowed to continue.</p>
        <p>Lines <b>40</b>&nbsp;&dash;&nbsp;<b>46</b> rest all necessary variables for this routine on our player class to the initial start values. Line <b>47</b> substracts your choosen amount of grain from your reserve.</p>
        <p>Our well-known <em>z</em> variable is back again. This time, it represents the ratio between your choosen grain amount and the demand. It then shifts this value by one. This means, that if you satisfied the demand for grain, y will be <em>0</em>. If you undercut the demand, the value will be negative. If you "overspend", the value will be positive.</p>
        <p>Interesting enough: If you overspend, the algorithm will cut <em>y</em> in half (in line <b>53</b>). If <em>z</em> is then still bigger than 0.25, the game will take this value, divide it by 10 and add 0.25 to it. I'm not quite sure why, but maybe we will figure it out down the line.</p>
        <p>In line <b>61</b>, <em>zp</em> is introduced: It will be added to <em>z</em> in line <b>75</b>, after being divided by 10. <em>zp</em> starts with an initial value of 50, which is reduced by the customs duty, the sales tax and the player income tax. The taxes have limits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Customs Duty: 0 to 100</li>
            <li>Sales Tax: 0 to 50</li>
            <li>Income Tax: 0 to 25</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This means, that <em>zp</em> can get as low as <em>-125</em>. If <em>zp</em> goes down to a negative value, it will be multiplied by justice. As a reminder, that's what justice stands for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>1</b>: Very fair</li>
            <li><b>2</b>: Moderate</li>
            <li><b>3</b>: Harsh</li>
            <li><b>4</b>: Outrageous</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Depending on your justice, zp can go down to as much as <em>-500</em>. However, in line <b>68</b>, the value is again divided by 10, effectively capping it at <em>-50</em> to <em>5</em>. If <em>zp</em> is still bigger than 0, then in line <b>72</b>, justice is subtracted from <em>3</em> and added to the value of <em>zp</em>. Finally, in line <b>75</b>, <em>zp</em> will again be divided by 10 and added to our previous value of <em>z</em>.</p>
        <p>Interesting enough, now <em>z</em> also gets a cap in line <b>77</b>, which will limit it to <em>0.5</em>.</p>
        <p>Between the lines <b>80</b> and <b>129</b>, the code branches off depending on whether you decided to spend less or more than the demand of grain.</p>
        <p>If you happen to spend less than the demand, lines <b>82</b>&nbsp;&dash;&nbsp;<b>96</b> will calculate the effects of this:</p>
        <p><code>(Convert.ToDouble(player.GrainDemand) - Convert.ToDouble(howMuch)) / player.GrainDemand * 100.0 - 9.0</code></p>
        <p>This code will give you a value of <em>x</em>, which is essentially the percentage of how much your released grain deviates from the demanded grain. If the demand is higher then what you provided, x will be positive. If the demand is lower than what you provided, x will be negative. However, x will be capped to 65. So if the demand is 20000, but you can only supply 2000, x won't go up to <em>81</em>, it will be capped at 65. Interestingly, if you overspend, this has no effect in this part of the code, as it will simply set <em>x</em> and <em>xp</em> to zero. That is kind of interesting, because this branch only should get entered if the provided amount of grain is already lower than the demand. So <em>x</em> should never get too low.</p>
        <p>The next two calls are <code>SerfsProcreating(player, 3.0)</code> and <code>SerfsDecomposing(player, xp + 8.0)</code>.</p>
        <p>These two function essentially use the same algorithmic logic, of course changing different values in the player class (<em>NewSerfs</em> for <em>SerfsProcreating</em>, and <em>DeadSerfs</em> for <em>SerfsDecomposing</em>). Btw, I did not come up with the name for theses methods.</p>
