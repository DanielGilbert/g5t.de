            <h2>dgMicMute</h2>

            <p>This is a tool which allows you to mute your microphone in a convenient way.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>One day, a co-worker asked if someone knows a small tool, which allows him to mute his microphone, like he can mute the audio.
            We were a little bit confused, because no one knows such a tool. However, most (if not all) Ultrabooks or Notebooks have a microphone equipped.
            So I decided to write this little tool.</p>

            <p>It resides in the notification area as a microfone symbol (keep in mind to make it visible, it's normally hidden). With a simple right-click, you can (un-)mute your microphone.
            It even has a *force-mode*, where it tries to prevent other applications from re-enabling the microphone (E.g. Skype does this. NSA might do it. :P).</p>

            <h3>Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mutes your microphone with a single left-click (on the icon)</li>
                <li>Adds a "force"-flag so that third party applications cannot "unmute" the microphone</li>
                <li>Hotkey! (Thanks <a href="https://github.com/sco3tt">sco3tt</a>!)</li>
                <li>Audible notification when switching the state! (Thanks <a href="https://github.com/AngryJKirk">AngryJKirk</a>!)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Binaries</h3>
            <p>If you came here by accident, and don't want the source, but rather precompiled binaries, head over to <a href="https://github.com/DanielGilbert/dgMicMute/releases">the Releases</a>. You might want to pick the topmost release.
            You can also just download the .exe that is provided <a href="./dgMicMuteSetup.exe">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>FAQ</h3>
            <h4>I cannot find the microphone icon!</h4>
            <p>It's located in the lower right part of the Windows taskbar. Depending on your settings, you might need to press the "^"-arrow that's next to the symbols.</p>
            <h4>Where do I set the hotkey?</h4>
            <p>Simply right-click on the icon, select "Settings..." and pick your Hotkey in the Settings.</p>
            <h4>Where do I set the autostart?</h4>
            <p>Simply right-click on the icon, select "Settings..." and activate Autostart.</p>
