# 7D Mad Rogue Kart
7D Mad Rogue Kart is a rogue-like, turn-based kart racing game, build in one week during the 7DRL 2023. Your goal is to finish first, while racing against characters you might be familiar with. ;)

You can also throw some obstacles in their way - but be aware: You are not the only one with this ability...

7D Mad Rogue Kart uses a custom engine, based on SFML. :)
